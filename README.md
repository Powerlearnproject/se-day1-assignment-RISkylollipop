Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintaining software and it's an approach to create high quality standand, relaible, maintainable and reusable software 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development Methodologies: Code development was strongly influence by outside forces, and the main purpose is to optimize exploitation of the limited hardware resources. the first compiler were define; operating system were noninteractive
2. Modeling Approach: the goal here is development of models that support the construction of software. which is now the most necessary and fundamental step of all software development.

3. Process versus product: The aim here is to reduce risk during development and improve the quality and productivity. contributing to the stage of the modeling approach.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirement gathering and analysis: This is the stage that we gather relevant information from the the customer/clients so as to develop a product to meet up with the expectation

2. Design: In the phase, the requirement gather that serves as a blueprint is used to breakdown the job step by step or serves as the architecture for implementing system development is derived

3. Implementation: This phase start once we get hold design document, And the design is practically translated to source code. And all other software component are implemented.

4. Testing: Testing start when the coding is fully completed to check for bug, defect and refractoring, retesting, regression testing is done until the product meet the customer expectation.

5. Deployment: Once the product is fully tested and it has meet the expectation, it is deploy to the production environment or first user acceptance experience testing is carry out depending on the customer expectation.

6. Maintanance: After deployment of the product on the production environment, Maintainance is next, that is if an issue comes up like lagging or slow processing the developer is to take care of the aspects and monitor against cyber attack.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Waterfall Methodologies Involve building of the software with a blueprint or roadmap
while agile Methodologies requires building in stages without having to follow a road map    

Waterfall Testing is done only when the development is complete    
while In Agile Development and Testing is done Concurrently


in Waterfall Methodologies Fault or defect can only be notice by user after deployment  
while in Agile, Each phase of development is shown to be tested by user, so defect are easily noticed/detect

Waterfall Methodologies Example: Phone preinstall applications

Agile Methodolosies Example: Meta Applications like Facebook and Whatsapp


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: The roles and responsibilities of software developers will include a range of tasks that involve the design, development, testing, and deployment of software programs and systems the reponsibilties also include debugging, testing, refractoring.

Quality Assurance Engineer: quality assurance (QA) engineer is a specialist responsible for testing software to ensure it meets established quality criteria and functions properly, including improvement suggestion, documentation, collaboration, Automation testing.


Product Manager: Software product manager heads and manages the software product management department. They oversee and overview the specialization, goals, structure, and expectations of the software product, the serve as the first user acceptance, including the planning and monitoring the requirements for producing the ideal software. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


Git is an example of a Version Control system (VCS): It is important for tracking code changes, coding collaboration and it is use to easily trace bug comes in, on a code

Visual Studio Code(VScode) is an example of an IDE(Integrated Development Environment) That can be use to write, edit, debug code which also come with some extersion for debugging and making coding easy.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Rigid deadlines: This can be overcome by practicing more Agile Methodologies.

Debugging: This can also be overcome by Agile methodologies by focus on a phase one after the other and after concurrent testing.

Communication Barrier: By using the agile methodologies the client might have busy schedule and we will require the stakeholder to provide their quality assurance manager which works includes overseeing of the development stages.




Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process by which we learn how to best formulate our instructions or “prompts” in order to get the most helpful answers from our AI, can also be define as the way in which we are creative with the instruction given to our AI in order understand and to provide more accurate result.

_Makes our work faster
_Improve the thinking of and individual us(er)
_Software engineer user to remember some basics of coding

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

_History of the world   >>> "Give a step by step detail of the beginning of the world"

_What is blood         >>> "Give a details of how a blood is formulated in human being"
